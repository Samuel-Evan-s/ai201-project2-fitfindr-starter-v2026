     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->

You tell FitFindr what you want in plain language, e.g. "vintage graphic tee under $30, size M". It searches the mock listings (Depop, ThredUp, Poshmark), picks the best match, and suggests outfits that combine it with pieces from your wardrobe (or general styling advice if your wardrobe is empty). It then writes a short caption you could post about the find. If nothing matches, it stops and tells you which part of the query to loosen.



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Filters the listings file by price and size, scores what is left by keyword overlap with the description, and returns the best matches.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str), `size` (str or None), `max_price` (float or None).
- **Returns:** A list of at most 10 listing dicts, best match first. Each dict has `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `style_tags` (list), `size`, `condition`, `price` (float), `colors` (list), `brand` (str or None), `platform`. Size matches on whole tokens, so "M" matches "S/M" and "M/L" but "S" does not match "US 9" and "L" does not match "XL". `max_price` is inclusive. Title and style-tag hits score 2, other fields score 1.
- **When it has nothing:** Returns `[]` (never None, never an exception).

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Asks the model for one or two outfits built around the new item and the user's wardrobe.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict, a listing), `wardrobe` (dict with an `items` list of wardrobe item dicts).
- **Returns:** A non-empty string of outfit suggestions, naming wardrobe pieces by their listed names.
- **When it has nothing:** If `wardrobe["items"]` is empty it returns general styling advice for the item instead. If the model returns blank text it returns a generic fallback line, so the result is never `""`.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Asks the model for a short, postable caption about the find.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str, from `suggest_outfit`), `new_item` (dict, a listing).
- **Returns:** A 2-4 sentence caption string that mentions the item, its price and its platform.
- **When it has nothing:** If `outfit` is empty or whitespace, returns the message "No outfit was provided, so there is nothing to write a caption about." and does not call the model.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, put a message in `session["error"]` that names the query and what to change (raise the price limit, drop the size, use broader keywords), and return the session without calling `suggest_outfit` or `create_fit_card`. Otherwise, take the first result as `session["selected_item"]` and go on to `suggest_outfit`, then `create_fit_card`.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** Regex, in `agent.py::parse_query`. It pulls a price ceiling from "under $30" / "below 30" / "$30", a size from "size M", and treats the rest as the description.

**What moves through the session:** `query` -> `parsed` -> `search_results` -> `selected_item` -> `outfit_suggestion` -> `fit_card`. Each tool reads its input back out of the session rather than from a local variable. `error` is set only when the run stops early.

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'designer ballgown size XXS under $5'

  Nothing matched 'designer ballgown' in size XXS under $5. Try to raise your price limit, drop the size, or use fewer or broader keywords (e.g. 'jacket' instead of a brand or style).
```

<!-- TODO (needs GEMINI_API_KEY in .env): paste the real output of
     python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30, size M' here. -->

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print([(x['title'], x['size'], x['price']) for x in search_listings('graphic tee', 'M', 30)])"
[('Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print', 'S/M', 18.0), ('Mesh Long-Sleeve Top — Black', 'S/M', 15.0)]
```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))"
<!-- TODO: paste real output once the API key is set -->
```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"
<!-- TODO: paste real output once the API key is set -->
```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:* A `search_listings` that filters on size. The starter warned that a plain substring test lets "s" match "US 9" and "l" match "XL".
- *What came back:* A first design that compared sizes as whole tokens instead of substrings.
- *What I changed:* I split each listing size into tokens (`S/M` becomes `s`, `m`) and match the requested size against those, so "M" finds "S/M" and "M/L", "S" no longer returns shoes, and "L" does not return "XL". I wrote this rule into the Tool Inventory.

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:* A `run_agent` loop that goes through the session and stops on an empty search, without needing the model key to test it.
- *What came back:* A loop with a step variable (`search`, `outfit`, `card`) and the branch right after search.
- *What I changed:* I tested it by replacing the two model tools with stubs that record what they were called with. The stub received the very same object as `session["selected_item"]`, and for an impossible query `fit_card` stayed `None`. My first empty-search message was only "no results", so I rewrote it to name the query and say which parts to relax.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
